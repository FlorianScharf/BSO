# Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO)
Accompanying code for article "Model Specification Searches in Structural Equation Modeling Using Bee Swarm Optimization". The scripts are organized as follows:
- Holzinger.R: Demo script demonstrating the procedure with the Holzinger-Swineford data set.
- BSO_main_function.R: contains the central function running BSO including a definition of all arguments and options
- fit_function.R: contains the fit function estimating the models and evaluating model fit
- tool_functions: collection of helper functions used within BSO
- fun1.txt: See for yourself.

Please find the scripts reproducing all reported analyses in the OSF repo: https://osf.io/kx4fg/?view\_only=b11dc4b6558342928353196f4762901f
